Development of Yield Models for Citrus Horticulture (NRSC)
The successful prediction of crop yield was largely based on the ability of sensors or
imagers to detect various canopy variables such as leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll
content, or leaf nitrogen content, which each are significantly associated with crop yield.
Previous studies on the application of remote sensing for yield estimation and mapping
were mainly performed on field crops. Few studies on the usefulness of remote sensing
of orchard crops have been reported. Yield modelling of citrus is one important aspect of
citrus orchard management. Perennial crops exhibit greater variability in canopy structure
and fruit yield than annual crops, and this is attributed to the internal mechanism of
alternate bearing in individual plants. Field observations of citrus trees have shown
that there is a wide variability in the numbers of new leaves and floral buds during the
earlier growing seasons, as well as wide variability in fruit yield. The differences in canopy
structure among trees during particular seasons may provide information related to
their fruit production level. If particular spectral features of canopy structure detected by
airborne hyperspectral imagery are found to be correlated with fruit yield, these canopy
spectral features can be used to develop a programme of tree-specific application
to improve horticultural profitability and minimize the impact on the environment.
Presently, yield of citrus is declined in terms of quality and quantity due to biotic, abiotic,
edaphic as well as various management factors in India. To improve the fruit quality by
alternate bearing though pruning and thinning of fruit of selected tree and development
of citrus yield modelling is essentially required using geospatial techniques. The use
of multispectral, hyper spectral and UAV data will help in the development of yield
modelling of citrus through geospatial analysis including AI/ML techniques in India.
